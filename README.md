# DungeonCrawl

A game written in C++ that runs in a command prompt window and takes input from the keyboard.  In the game you move the player through a "field" that is filled with traps. The goal is to make it through without stepping on a trap.  Traps are generated randomly with logic to keep traps from appearing on start, finish, or the same space twice.  Error handling in place to keep the player from going off the board.
